The `or` and `and` operators take two parameters and return a boolean result. 

`not` flips a boolean from true to false, or vice versa. 

`any` will return `true` if there are any `true` values in a array sequence, and `all` will return true if _all_ elements in an array are true.

These are most commonly used with the `select` operator to filter particular nodes.
