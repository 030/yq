4.13.0:

BREAKING CHANGE - the `as` variable operator (e.g. `.a as $x`) now makes a _copy_ of the node(s) at the 
path rather than a reference. This is in order to make it work more like the `jq` equivalent. 

This means any updates made to that variable do not update the original.

There's a new operator `ref` that will make a reference (and allow multiple updates to the original path by referencing the variable).
Sorry for any inconvenience caused!.
