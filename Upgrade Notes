# New Features
  - Keeps comments and formatting (e.g. inline arrays)!
  - Handles anchors!
  - Can specify yaml tags (e.g. !!int), quoting values no longer sufficient, need to specify the tag value instead.
  - JSON output works for all commands! Yaml files with multiple documents are printed out as one JSON document per line. 

# Update scripts file format has changed to be more powerful. Comments can be added, and delete commands have been introduced.

# Merge command
- New flag 'autocreates' missing entries in target by default, new flag to turn that off.
